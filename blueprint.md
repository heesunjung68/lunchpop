## GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

To deploy your project directly to GitHub Pages, please follow these manual steps:

1.  **Commit your changes**: Ensure all your project files (including `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, and the `images/` folder) are committed to your GitHub repository.
    *   You might need to use `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit for lunch menu generator"` if you haven't already.
2.  **Push to your repository**: Push your changes to the `main` or `master` branch of your `heesunjung68/lunchpop` repository.
    *   You might need to use `git push origin main` (or `master`).
3.  **Configure GitHub Pages**:
    *   Go to your `heesunjung68/lunchpop` repository on GitHub.com.
    *   Click on **Settings**.
    *   In the left sidebar, click on **Pages** (under the "Code and automation" section).
    *   Under "Build and deployment", for "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
    *   For "Branch", select your primary branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and choose the `/ (root)` folder.
    *   Click **Save**.
4.  **Wait for deployment**: GitHub Pages will then build and deploy your site. This may take a few minutes. You can usually see the deployment status in the "Actions" tab of your repository.
5.  **Access your site**: Once deployed, your site will be available at a URL similar to `https://heesunjung68.github.io/lunchpop/`.

I cannot directly perform these Git commands or configure GitHub settings from this environment. You will need to execute them manually.
