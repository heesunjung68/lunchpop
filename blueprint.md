# Project Blueprint: English Dinner Menu Recommendation Website

## Overview

This project creates a simple, single-page web application that recommends a random English dinner menu item from a predefined list of 10 options. The website will display the recommended dish's name and an accompanying image. The application will be designed for a modern, visually appealing, and responsive user experience.

## Detailed Outline

- **HTML (`index.html`):** Sets up the basic page structure, including a header, a display area for the recommended dish name and image, and a "Get New Recommendation" button.
- **CSS (`style.css`):** Provides modern, visually appealing, and responsive styling for the user interface.
- **JavaScript (`main.js`):** Contains the core logic. It will define an array of 10 English dinner menu items with their corresponding image paths (from the local `images/` directory), randomly select an item, and display its name and image on the page.
- **Images:** Utilizes 10 selected images from the local `images/` directory to accompany the menu recommendations.
